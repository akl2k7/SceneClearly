			<h2>Prices</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-9">
					<p>Due to the fact that all houses and buildings are different, we have to see the house or the building to give a more precise price.  Many times your name address and phone number is all that is needed to get the price process in action.  Also information on any animals in the yard is helpful.  We are not afraid of dogs but just like to be warned of their presence.</p>
